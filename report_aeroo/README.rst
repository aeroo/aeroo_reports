Aeroo Reports
=============
Aeroo Reports is a module for generating reports based on OpenOffice documents.

This version of the module is very different from the original version from Alistek.
Many advanced features where removed because the code was fuzzy. The objective
was to clean every non absolutely required features.

The advantage of this version is that you don't need an Aeroo DOCS server in order
to convert your reports from a format to another.
Instead, you need to install soffice on your Odoo server.
